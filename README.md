Application development in chapter III of Ignite, a Rocketseat course.




## Lessons Learned

Follow, some learnings that I had while building this project:

- Next.js fundamentals;
- SSG (Static Site Generation) and SSR (Server Side Rendering);
- Autentication with Next Auth;
- Basic crud operations in FaunaDB;
- Using API/webhooks of Stripe to receive card payments;
- Working with PRISMIC CMS (Content Management System );
- React's cloneElement function was new for me...

What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?

- consumption of an PRISMIC updated documentation;
- understand the file scoped route of Next, that is a little bit different of React;
